### And dont forget, pugs aren't cute, they're horrible. They're bred in such a way that they practically can't breathe for most of their lives!

### They're literally bred into suffering their entire lives

### They shouldn't exist.

### Please look at [this article](https://www.pugsclub.org/health/pug-breathing-problems/) for more info

I am truly sorry for breaking you're heart, I really wish it wasnt true, but wishes rarely, if ever change the truth.
